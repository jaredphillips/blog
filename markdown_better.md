## Markdown Better

When I decided to blog again, I wanted decided that I wanted sharpen a new skill. I had used Markdown before for a couple of rails projects but I felt like I could become better at it. The [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) article wasn't much help surprisingly, considering that John Gruber (and Arron Swartz) wrote the dang thing.

What is markdown? Markdown is, (as explained by Wikipedia) as a plain text formatting syntax that can be optionally converted to HTML. Cool.

The best learning resource for me so far has been this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) by [Adam Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p). Thanks Adam. 

I also really like the idea of using git and github to push the content. I've only ever experimented with branching in git so I really want to become better at that as well. Make each blog entry its own branch and merge them back into master. That will be step two of the learning process. 

Thirdly, I really love using [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) for writing. I find that it strips away all the fluff and just leaves a nice blank canvas to work on. 

So there it is, the reason why I'm writing this blog using markdown and git.
