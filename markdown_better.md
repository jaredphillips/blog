When I decided to blog again, I wanted decided that I wanted sharpen a new skill. I had used Markdown before for a couple of rails projects but I felt like I could become better at it. The [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) article wasn't much help surprisingly, considering that John Gruber (and Arron Swartz) wrote the dang thing.

What is markdown? Markdown is, (as explained by Wikipedia) as a plain text formatting syntax that can be optionally converted to HTML. Cool.

The best learning resource for me so far has been this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) by [Adam Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p). Thanks Adam.
