As some of you may already know, [hackerYou](http://www.hackeryou.com) is going to be moving into our brand new Queen Street location tomorrow. Every one on the team is super excited and can't wait to show students and the community our awesome new space. You can check out some of the progress [here](http://thelabtoronto.tumblr.com/).

If you're ever in the neighbourhood, drop in and we'll give you the tour.
